<ins>A few details:</ins>

Larvae of the Asian Tiger Mosquito *Aedes albopictus* were reared at different densities (5, 10, 15 larvae) in otherwise identical conditions. 

Adult females were housed and fed blood meals repeatedly and lifetime survival and reproductive schedules were gathered for ten replicates of each density treatment. 

Each replicate contained 24 adult females to begin with. 

Data include density treatment (larval density), replicate number (10 per density treatment), day from experimental start (x), survival to day x, and reproductive output on day x. Days with no
value for reproductive output were days that were assessed for survival and reproductive output but failed to produce any eggs.
